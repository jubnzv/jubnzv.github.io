I use this site to write down and share something that doesn't fit in a single Telegram message or email.

This is a static site generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which uses a slightly modified [smol](https://github.com/jubnzv/smol) theme. Its sources [are available](https://github.com/jubnzv/jubnzv.github.io) on GitHub.

If you want to contact me, feel free to write to me at [Telegram](https://t.me/jubnzv) or send a email to `jubnzv` at `gmail.com` (you can encrypt your message with [this public key](/public.key)).
